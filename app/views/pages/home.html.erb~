  <h1>What the %$#@ is tech.talk? </h1>

  <p>
Well, it's an experimental web application written by Aslan Varoqua
using Ruby on Rails, an MVC framework for the Ruby Programming Language. The application
is a place where users can post their professional profiles, post their thoughts, look for gigs, 
and connect with like minded people. Tech companies can also create accounts where web, software, data, and 
other professionals can easily keep up with their products and services. Tech companies can 
also advertise their services directly to potential customers who indicate interest in their industries thus increasing the chance of sales. 

In other words, this is social networking for tech enthusiests and the people that do business with them.
